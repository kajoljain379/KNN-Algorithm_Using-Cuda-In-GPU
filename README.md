# KNN-Algorithm_Using-Cuda-In-GPU
This project contain serial implementation of KNN algorithm and compare its performance with parallel implementation in GPU.k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) is a classification algorithm
used in machine learning and data mining applications such as
email spam filtering, content retrieval , customer segmentation
in online shopping websites etc.In the algorithm, the variable
k is defined by the user.k-NN classifiers find the k number for
training set, which has similar or is closest to the test data.The
k-NN algorithm can be used for classification, based on the
distance to the k nearest members ,the algorithm decides which
class the given input should belongs to and then give corresponding output.


## Objective
High parallelism can be achieved using GPU and in com-
paratively lesser cost than CPU.
So we are trying to do the same task in GPU which speedup
the execution by 99% .We will do the implementation consists
of different level of parallelism like searching ,sorting and
other parallely executable task.
